\section*{Introduction}
For CW2, I have decided to implement and explore the behaviour of the classical \textit{Reinforcement Learning} algorithm using \textit{Temporal Difference Learning}. Reinforcement learning was developed from an area of psychology under the name trial-and-error learning \cite{woodworth1937experimental} and the area of the optimal control problem in the form of Markov Decision Processes \cite{bellman1957dynamic} \cite{bellman1957markov}. Temporal-difference (TD) methods for reinforcement learning were proposed as a model of classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning in 1987 \cite{sutton1987temporal}, and refined to the TD learning rule in 1990 \cite{sutton1990time}.
