## Coursework (CW) 1
This coursework tested the knowledge and understanding of entropy with cases where the actual probability distributions were not known and estimates needed to be found. Results show the comparison of estimating the distributions using sample data naively and with Laplace smoothing. This is shown in Q5 of the CW.
